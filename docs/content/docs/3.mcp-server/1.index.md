Nuxt AI includes a built-in Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides development tools specifically designed to enhance your AI development workflow.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for communication between AI models and tools. It allows AI assistants like Claude, GPT, and others to interact with your codebase through a set of defined tools.

> ðŸ“š **Learn More:** Explore the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for a comprehensive introduction to the protocol.

The MCP server included with Nuxt AI provides a set of tools that can be used by AI assistants to:

1. **Query your codebase** - Access information about your application structure
2. **Generate documentation** - Help create and maintain documentation
3. **Manage AI rules** - Create and configure rules for AI assistants
4. **Test AI integrations** - Validate AI features in your application

## Server Features

The Nuxt AI MCP server includes several features that make AI development easier:

### Tools

List of tools available in the MCP server.

## Getting Started

To use the MCP server, you need to:

1. Make sure it's enabled in your configuration (it's enabled by default in development)
2. Access the MCP server interface at the configured path (default: `/mcp`)

Learn more about configuring the MCP server in the [Configuration](/docs/mcp-server/configuration) section.

## Connecting to the MCP Server

To use the MCP server with your AI client (like Cursor or Claude), you'll need to configure the client to connect to your local MCP server instance. The connection details will depend on your configuration, but by default:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
- **Protocol Version**: `0.1`

### Cursor Configuration

For Cursor, you can add the MCP server configuration to your `.cursor/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "ai.mcpServers": [
    {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
      "version": "0.1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Other AI Clients

For other AI clients that support MCP, refer to their specific documentation on how to configure MCP server connections. You'll typically need to provide:

1. The MCP server URL
2. The protocol version
3. Any additional authentication if configured

Make sure your Nuxt development server is running (`npm run dev`) before attempting to connect to the MCP server.
