Nuxt AI includes a built-in Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides development tools specifically designed to enhance your AI development workflow.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for communication between AI models and tools. It allows AI assistants like Claude, GPT, and others to interact with your codebase through a set of defined tools.

The MCP server included with Nuxt AI provides a set of tools that can be used by AI assistants to:

1. **Query your codebase** - Access information about your application structure
2. **Generate documentation** - Help create and maintain documentation
3. **Manage AI rules** - Create and configure rules for AI assistants
4. **Test AI integrations** - Validate AI features in your application
