---

Nuxt AI includes a set of pre-defined rules that can be used with AI assistants like Cursor and Claude to enhance your development workflow.

## What are AI Rules?

AI rules are configuration files that provide context and instructions to AI assistants when working with your codebase. They help the AI understand:

- The structure and purpose of your project
- Coding standards and conventions
- Best practices for specific frameworks or libraries
- Documentation requirements

Different AI assistants use different formats for rules:

- **Cursor** uses `.mdc` files in the `.cursor/rules` directory
- **Claude** can use standard Markdown (`.md`) files
- Other AI assistants may have their own formats

## Rules in Nuxt AI

Nuxt AI generates and manages rules for various AI assistants, focusing on:

1. **Project Structure** - Understanding the Nuxt project layout and key files
2. **Nuxt Best Practices** - Guidelines for working with the Nuxt ecosystem
3. **Typescript** - Guidelines for working with Typescript

## Benefits of AI Rules

Using AI rules provides several benefits:

- **Consistency** - Ensure AI assistants follow your project's conventions
- **Efficiency** - Reduce the need to repeatedly explain your project to AI
- **Quality** - Guide AI to produce higher-quality code and suggestions
- **Learning** - AI can learn from your existing patterns and best practices

## Getting Started

By default, Nuxt AI will generate rules for Cursor in the `.cursor/rules` directory. You can configure this behavior in your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ai: {
    dev: {
      client: 'cursor', // Choose between 'cursor' or 'claude'
      rules: {
        enabled: true
      }
    }
  }
})
```
