title: Creating Custom Rules
description: Learn how to create your own AI assistant rules for Nuxt AI.
---

While Nuxt AI provides default rules for AI assistants, you may want to create custom rules specific to your project. This guide shows how to create and manage custom rules.

## Rule Formats

Different AI assistants use different rule formats:

### Cursor Rules (`.mdc`)

Cursor uses Markdown-based rule files with a specific structure:

```markdown [example-rule.mdc]
Rule Name: project-structure.mdc
Description: Explains the structure of the project to help the assistant navigate the codebase.

# Project Structure

## Context
This is a Nuxt project that uses the Nuxt AI module to integrate AI features.

## Requirements
- Follow Nuxt's file-based routing structure
- Keep components in the components directory
- Store API routes in the server/api directory

## Examples
<example>
// Good component placement
// components/AiChat.vue
<script setup>
const { messages } = useChat()
</script>
</example>

<example type="invalid">
// Don't place components in pages directory
// pages/Chat.vue
<script setup>
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/vue' // Don't manually import
</script>
</example>

## Critical Rules
- Always use auto-imported composables from the Nuxt AI module
- Follow Nuxt naming conventions for files and directories
- Place API routes in the server/api directory
```

### Claude Rules (`.md`)

Claude can use standard Markdown files:

```markdown [project-guidelines.md]
# Project Guidelines

## Structure
- This is a Nuxt project using the Nuxt AI module
- Follow standard Nuxt directory structure
- Components are in the components directory
- API routes are in the server/api directory

## Best Practices
- Use auto-imported composables rather than manual imports
- Follow Nuxt naming conventions
- Use environment variables for API keys
```

## Creating Rules

### 1. Define the Purpose

Before creating a rule, define its purpose:
- What information should the AI assistant know about your project?
- What conventions should it follow?
- What examples would help illustrate good and bad practices?

### 2. Choose a Format

Select the appropriate format based on the AI assistants you're using:
- `.mdc` for Cursor
- `.md` for Claude
- Other formats as needed

### 3. Write the Rule

Structure your rule with the following sections:

1. **Context** - Background information about your project
2. **Requirements** - Specific requirements and conventions
3. **Examples** - Good and bad examples to illustrate your points
4. **Critical Rules** - Key points that must be followed

### 4. Place in the Correct Location

Place your custom rules in the appropriate directories:

- Cursor rules: `.cursor/rules/`
- Claude rules: Typically passed directly or stored in a project directory

## Integrating with Nuxt AI

To integrate your custom rules with Nuxt AI, you can:

### Option 1: Use the Default Rules Directory

Place your custom rules in the default rules directory configured in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ai: {
    options: {
      rules: {
        enabled: true,
        path: '.cursor/rules' // Cursor rules will be generated here
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Option 2: Use the MCP Server

The MCP server included with Nuxt AI can help manage and generate rules. Access the MCP server at the configured path (default: `/mcp`) and use the Rules Generator tool.

## Best Practices

When creating custom rules:

1. **Be Specific** - Provide clear guidance rather than vague suggestions
2. **Use Examples** - Include real examples from your codebase
3. **Update Regularly** - Keep rules updated as your project evolves
4. **Focus on Patterns** - Emphasize patterns rather than specific implementations
5. **Include Context** - Provide sufficient context about your project's purpose and structure
