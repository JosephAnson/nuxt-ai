Nuxt AI creates rules that can be used with various AI assistant clients. This guide covers the clients currently supported and how to use rules with each one.

### Integration with Nuxt AI

Nuxt AI automatically generates Cursor rules in the configured path. The configuration in `nuxt.config.ts` is managed through development options:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ai: {
    // Development-only options
    devOptions: {
      // Choose which AI client to use ('cursor', 'claude', ...)
      client: 'cursor',
      // Rules configuration
      rules: {
        enabled: true, // Default is true
      },
    }
  }
})
```

The `devOptions` field contains all development-related configurations:
- `client`: Choose between 'cursor' or 'claude' as your AI assistant
- `rules`: Enable/disable rule generation
