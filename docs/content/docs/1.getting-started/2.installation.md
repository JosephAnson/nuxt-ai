## Install the Package

Choose your preferred package manager to install Nuxt AI:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -D @josephanson/nuxt-ai
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add --dev @josephanson/nuxt-ai
```

```bash [npm]
npm install --save-dev @josephanson/nuxt-ai
```

```bash [bun]
bun add -D @josephanson/nuxt-ai
```
::

## Register the Module

Add the Nuxt AI module to your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@josephanson/nuxt-ai']
})
```

### Configure the Module (Optional)

You can add additional configuration to enable specific features and providers:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@josephanson/nuxt-ai'],
  ai: {
    dev: {
      client: 'cursor', // Default AI client to use
      rules: true, // Default is true
    }
  }
})
```

::tip
The `client` option specifies which AI client format to use for rules generation. Currently supported value is `'cursor'` (default).

::tip
It's recommended to use environment variables for API keys rather than hardcoding them in your configuration.

## Connecting to the MCP Server

To use the MCP server with your AI client (like Cursor or Claude), you'll need to configure the client to connect to your local MCP server instance. The connection details will depend on your configuration, but by default:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
- **Protocol Version**: `0.1`

### Cursor Configuration

For Cursor, you can add the MCP server configuration to your `.cursor/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vite": {
      "url": "http://localhost:5200/__mcp/sse"
    },
    "nuxt": {
      "url": "http://localhost:4000/__mcp/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Other AI Clients

For other AI clients that support MCP, refer to their specific documentation on how to configure MCP server connections. You'll typically need to provide:

1. The MCP server URL
2. The protocol version
3. Any additional authentication if configured

::tip{icon="i-lucide-plug"}
Make sure your Nuxt development server is running (`npm run dev`) before attempting to connect to the MCP server.
